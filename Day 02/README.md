# Day 2: Operators

Welcome to Day 2 of our coding journey! Today, weâ€™ll dive into operatorsâ€”essential tools for manipulating data in your programs. Letâ€™s get started!

## Tasks/Activities

### Arithmetic Operations
1. **Addition**: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
2. **Subtraction**: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
3. **Multiplication**: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
4. **Division**: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
5. **Remainder**: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

### Assignment Operators
1. Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result.
2. Use the `--` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result.

### Comparison Operators
1. Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result.
2. Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result.
3. Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result.

### Logical Operators
1. Write a program that combines two conditions using the `&&` operator and logs the result.
2. Write a program that combines two conditions using the `||` operator and logs the result.
3. Write a program that negates a condition using the `!` operator and logs the result.

### Ternary Operator
1. Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

## Feature Request

### Arithmetic Operations Script
Create a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

### Comparison and Logical Operators Script
Develop a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

### Ternary Operator Script
Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

## Achievement
By completing these activities, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using different operators.
- Understand comparison and logical operators.
- Be able to use the ternary operator effectively.
